<br>
<p>In this learning unit, we will do a coding challenge similar to those you will have in a technical interview.</p>
<p>In order to train you for those important moments, we have created a <a href="http://materials.ironhack.com/s/HkAY386rl">Codewars</a> kata.</p>
<h2 class="raw">How to confront the interview</h2>
<p>It is important to think about the methodology as well, not only to deliver the first working code you can think of.</p>
<p>Remember in a coding interview a lot of people can reach a possible solution, so you have to make your best effort to stand out.</p>
<h2 class="raw">Kata description</h2>
<p>We are going to do the kata <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/directions-reduction/train/javascript">Directions Reduction</a>.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>You have limited time to complete the code and pass all the test included in the kata.</p>
<p>Read the description of the problem carefully and pay attention to the required returning value.</p>
<p>Finally, deliver your solution in <strong>Codewars</strong> and compare it with the community and classmates solutions to learn about different approaches.</p>
