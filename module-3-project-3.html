# Project #3: MERN Web Application -->
<p><em>Find below the general guidelines. Please check in with your instructor to confirm their specific requirements (if they have any). Good luck!</em></p>
<h2 class="raw">Introduction</h2>
<p>We are almost at the end of the journey. In our time together, we’ve looked at tons of different programming concepts and techniques. <strong>This is where you get to show it all off!</strong></p>
<p>Your 3rd and the final project will be a <strong>single-page Web application</strong> using the <strong>MERN stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express, React &amp; Node.js) that <strong>you will work on in pairs or alone</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also practice some <strong>UX and Agile methodologies</strong> by following <a href="https://trello.com/b/vnXgh1Y8/trello-template-final-project">the final project Trello board</a>. When planning your project with the teaching staff, make a copy of this Trello board and create tickets for all the tasks you need to do in order to successfully complete this project. Utilize maximally all the advantages of using Trello as a tool for implementing the agile practice. Take a look at <a href="https://trello.com/b/6otslC4i/template-board-agile-with-trello">Template Board: Agile with Trello</a> example.</p>
<p>As usual, you and the Ironhack staff will vote for your favorites and award three medals: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.</p>
<!-- **Medalists get to present in the Hackshow**, our public event for showcasing students. -->

<p>*<em>Every day, during project weeks, you will start with this activity. Take a minute to update your colleagues with your progress: what did you do so far, do you feel on the track, behind or ahead, what’s your plan for today and do you think you’ll have any blockers.</em></p>
<h3 class="raw">For both: two days before the presentation day</h3>
<p><em>Presentation Practice</em>: About You &amp; Your Project + Demo. Refer to the Presentation Section to see how to create your presentation.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="raw">Presentation day</h3>
<p>Finally, it’s time for your real presentation. You will present your projects to the staff and other students. Remember to dress at least one degree nicer than normal.
Check out the Demo Tips.</p>
<h2 class="raw">Updated Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>Your app must:</p>
<ol>
<li class="raw"><strong>Use React</strong> for all of the user-facing parts of your application.</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Use Express</strong> for your <strong>API backend</strong> that your React app will communicate with.</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Use Mongoose</strong> for models and database communication.</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Have 3 models <em>or more</em></strong>.
Having one for users is a no-brainer.
The other two should represent the main functionality of your app.
Don’t force it if having a 3rd model doesn’t make sense.</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Have validation on its models</strong> with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Include sign up, log in &amp; log out functionality</strong> with encrypted passwords (or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Have <em>two</em> repos on GitHub</strong>. One for your React application and the other for your Express API backend.</li>
<li class="raw">Have at least <strong>1 commit per day</strong> that you worked on it.</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Be deployed online</strong> using Heroku, so anybody could use your app.</li>
</ol>
<p>Responsive design <strong>is not a requirement</strong>. <br></p>
<h2 class="raw">Updated Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
<li class="raw">A <strong>working MERN stack application, built by you</strong> that runs on a server.</li>
<li class="raw">A <strong>deploy of your app</strong> on Heroku.</li>
<li class="raw">The <strong>two URLs</strong> of your <strong>GitHub repositories</strong> (React &amp; Express).</li>
<li class="raw">The URL of the <strong>React app</strong>.</li>
<li class="raw">The URL of the <strong>slides for your app’s presentation</strong>.</li>
<li class="raw">Your <strong>GitHub repos</strong> should have the <strong>URL of your live app</strong> in the URL section.</li>
<li class="raw">You must present your app during Project #3 final presentations (last day of Project #3 time).</li>
</ul>
<!-- Wireframes **are not a deliverable**. <br>
User stories **are not a deliverable**. -->
<h2 class="raw">Presentations</h2>
<p>Project #3 presentation will focus more on you again since we are getting closer to the hiring fair and you have to be able to pitch yourself properly.</p>
<h3 class="raw">Format</h3>
<ul>
<li class="raw">Talking with Slides: <strong>3 minutes</strong></li>
<li class="raw">Demo: <strong>2 minutes</strong></li>
<li class="raw">Total: <strong>5 minutes</strong></li>

<h3 class="raw">Attire</h3>
<ul>
<li class="raw">Dress nicely for this and all final project presentations (last day of each project’s time).</li>
<li class="raw">Dress at least <strong>one degree more elegantly</strong> than you usually dress for class.</li>
<li class="raw"><em>Examples</em>:
<ul>
<li class="raw">If you wear t-shirts every day, wear a button-down shirt.</li>
<li class="raw">If you wear jeans every day, wear some slacks.</li>
<li class="raw">If you wear sneakers every day, wear nicer shoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="raw">Slide Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li class="raw">All presentations will be done <strong>from a staff member’s computer</strong>, so <strong>your slides need to be online</strong>.</li>
<li class="raw">PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind <strong>will not be accepted</strong>.</li>
<li class="raw">Suggested online slide applications:
<ul>
<li class="raw"><a href="https://slides.com/">Slides</a></li>
<li class="raw"><a href="https://prezi.com/">Prezi</a></li>
<li class="raw"><a href="https://www.google.com/slides/about/">Google Slides</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="raw">Presentation Structure</h3>
<ol>
<li class="raw"><strong>Title Slide</strong> (1 slide): your project’s name &amp; your name</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>About Me</strong> (1-2 slides):
<ul>
<li class="raw">Where are you from?</li>
<li class="raw">What are some interesting facts about you? (hobbies, travels, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Project Elevator Pitch</strong> (1-2 slides):
<ul>
<li class="raw">What is your project?</li>
<li class="raw">How does it work?</li>
<li class="raw">Why did you choose it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Technical Challenge</strong> (1-2 slides):
<ul>
<li class="raw">What was <strong>the most important</strong> technical challenge you faced?</li>
<li class="raw">How did you overcome that challenge?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Big Mistake</strong> (1-2 slides):
<ul>
<li class="raw">What was <strong>the biggest</strong> mistake you made during this project?</li>
<li class="raw">What did you learn from it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Demo Slide</strong> (1 slide): literally says “DEMO”
with <strong>a link</strong> to your project so you can open it easily</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Closing Slide</strong> (1 slide): your project’s name, your name &amp; a <em>“Thank You”</em></li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Total</strong>: 7-11 slides</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="raw">Presentation Structure Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li class="raw"><strong>Don’t</strong> include a slide just for the technologies.</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Don’t</strong> include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Don’t</strong> include a slide for GitHub graphs.</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Don’t</strong> go into detail about how the app works. Your demo is where you want to do that.</li>
<li class="raw">If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation, feel free to do so. This suggested structure is mostly for people who don’t know what to do.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="raw">Demo Tips</h3>
<ol>
<li class="raw">Plan what you are going to demo and <strong>practice it on the live site</strong>. That way you won’t be surprised if something breaks on the live version.</li>
<li class="raw"><strong>Deploy early</strong> so you can squash bugs. There are <em>always</em> bugs on the live site at first.</li>
<li class="raw">Add a <strong>link to your live project</strong> to your DEMO slide so you can start it smoothly.</li>
<li class="raw">Your app’s colors and sizing <strong>might look different on the projector</strong>. If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.</li>
<li class="raw">If your app is on Heroku, <strong>refresh it before you present</strong>. Otherwise, there will be a delay in the initial load.</li>
</ol>
